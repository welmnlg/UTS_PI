1. Write a Python program that reads in a whole number and divides it by number of days this year and displays the result with eleven decimal places if they exist (rounded up).
2. Write a Python program that reads a number (today's test date) and prints the product of all the values from 1 to that number.
3. Write a Python program that reads in a number and prints the date that number of days from now in this format: Monday on 25 March 2024.
4. Write a Python class that calculates and stores the height and weight of a person in metric.
The BMI is calculated using this formula:
Weight/Height^2
Weight is in pound and height is in feet.
The class should have two properties named: Weight and Height
The class should have two methods:
â€¢ BMI-Value This takes no arguments and returns a decimal value of the BMI;
Equals - This should override the equals method from the object class to compare the weight and height of two BMI objects. To override the equal method you should implement this method: eq (self, other) and return a boolean.
5. Write a program that reads in integer numbers from a text file named input.txt in the same directory as the executing program.
Print the sum of the numbers with comma separators and three digits.
